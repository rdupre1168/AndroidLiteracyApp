This project is an Android implementation of a web based app for the nonprofit organization Hear A Tale.
The app aims to aid second grade students in learning literacy skills inside and outside of the classroom. 
Currently, this repository contains just a small excerpt of code that we wrote to demo for our client, this code
simply includes the implementation of the home page of our app as well as button capabilities to navigate to the
'consonants' and 'vowels' sections of the app and back to the home page. As of yet, no further functionality is available.
